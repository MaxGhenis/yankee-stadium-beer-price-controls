# Alcohol Tax Analysis: Current vs Optimal

## Current Tax Structure (NYC/Yankee Stadium)

### Excise Taxes (per 12 oz beer)
- **Federal excise tax**: \$0.05 (large brewers at \$18/barrel)
- **New York State**: \$0.013 (\$0.14/gallon)
- **NYC additional**: \$0.011 (\$0.12/gallon)
- **Total excise**: **\$0.074** (~0.6% of \$12.50 price)

### Sales Tax
- **NYC sales tax**: 8.875%
- **On \$12.50 beer**: \$1.02
- **Share of final price**: 8.2%

### Total Current Taxation
- **Total tax per beer**: **\$1.09**
- **Share of consumer price**: 8.7%
- **Pre-tax price to stadium**: \$11.41

## External Costs (Not Internalized by Stadium)

Based on academic literature (Carpenter & Dobkin 2015, Manning et al. 1991):

### Crime Externalities: \$2.50/beer
- Assault (10% alcohol ↑ → 1% assault ↑)
- Sexual assault (10% alcohol ↑ → 2.9% rape ↑)
- Vandalism, disorderly conduct
- Police, courts, incarceration costs
- **Concentrated around stadium** on game days

### Health Externalities: \$1.50/beer
- Emergency room visits
- Trauma care (fights, accidents)
- Long-run health system burden
- Drunk driving crashes (to/from stadium)
- Lost productivity

### Total External Cost: \$4.00/beer

## Pigouvian Tax Analysis

### Current Situation
```
External cost:           $4.00/beer
Current tax:             $1.09/beer
Tax gap:                 $2.91/beer
Externalities covered:   27.3%
```

### Optimal Pigouvian Tax

Under Pigouvian theory, optimal tax = marginal external cost:

**Optimal tax: \$4.00/beer**

This would:
- **Internalize** all external costs
- **Reduce** consumption to socially optimal level
- **Raise revenue** for affected communities (\$2.91 × beers sold)

### Revenue Implications (per game)

At current consumption (~40,000 beers/game):

**Current tax revenue:**
- Excise: \$2,960/game
- Sales: \$40,800/game
- **Total: \$43,760/game**

**Under optimal Pigouvian tax (+\$2.91/beer):**
- Additional revenue: ~\$116,400/game (if quantity unchanged)
- But: Higher price → lower consumption → lower revenue
- With elasticity -0.29 (semi-log), price increase → moderate reduction

**Annual implications (81 home games):**
- Current: \$3.5M/season in taxes
- Optimal additional: \$9.4M/season (if quantity constant)
- Actual: \$6-8M/season (accounting for demand reduction)

## Stadium vs Society Perspective

### What Stadium Internalizes (already in \$12.50 price):
✅ Experience degradation (drunk fans hurt other customers)
✅ Brand/reputation damage
✅ Crowd management costs
✅ Capacity constraints

**Effective internalized cost: \$7.50/beer** (via convex cost function)

### What Society Bears (NOT internalized):
❌ Crime in surrounding neighborhood
❌ Public health costs
❌ Drunk driving
❌ Non-attendee costs

**External cost: \$4.00/beer**

### Policy Implication

Current taxes capture only **27% of external costs**.

**Optimal policy**: Additional \$2.91/beer Pigouvian tax on stadium alcohol

This would:
1. Reduce consumption to socially optimal level
2. Raise \$6-8M/year for affected communities
3. Not affect stadium profit maximization (it's a tax, not price control)
4. Allow stadium to keep current pricing structure

## Comparison to Other Pigouvian Taxes

| Good | External Cost | Current Tax | Tax Coverage |
|------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Stadium beer** | \$4.00/unit | \$1.09/unit | 27% |
| Cigarettes | \$5-10/pack | ~\$5-8/pack | 50-80% |
| Gasoline | \$0.50-2.00/gal | \$0.50-0.70/gal | 25-100% |
| Carbon | \$50-100/ton | \$0-30/ton | 0-60% |

Stadium beer is **undertaxed** relative to externalities compared to cigarettes, similar to gasoline/carbon.

## Alternative Policies

### Option 1: Pigouvian Tax (+\$2.91/beer)
- ✅ Efficient (marginal cost = marginal benefit)
- ✅ Raises revenue
- ✅ Preserves stadium pricing autonomy
- ❌ Politically difficult ("beer tax")

### Option 2: Price Floor (\$16.50)
- Would achieve similar consumption reduction
- No tax revenue
- Stadium keeps higher margin
- Equivalent to giving stadium the tax revenue

### Option 3: Quantity Restrictions
- Beer cut-off after 7th inning (some stadiums do this)
- 2-beer purchase limit per transaction
- Less efficient than price mechanisms

### Option 4: Combination
- Moderate tax (+\$1.50) + 7th inning cutoff
- Balances efficiency and feasibility
