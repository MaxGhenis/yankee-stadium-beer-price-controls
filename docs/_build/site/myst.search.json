Using a calibrated partial equilibrium model with literature-based demand elasticities, we simulate the effects of a $7 beer price ceiling on consumer welfare, stadium revenue, attendance, and alcohol-related externalities. We find that such price controls generate substantial unintended consequences through complementarity effects between tickets and beer. Specifically, a $7 beer ceiling (44% reduction from current $12.50) induces the stadium to raise ticket prices by approximately $32 (36% increase), resulting in a 38% decline in attendance despite a 108% increase in per-capita beer consumption. Stadium profit falls by $575,000 per game ($47 million annually), while external costs from alcohol consumption increase by 97%.\n\nOur analysis introduces a novel distinction between costs that stadiums internalize (crowd management, brand damage, experience degradation affecting other customers) and true social externalities (neighborhood crime, public health costs). We show that observed prices ($12.50) are approximately profit-maximizing when accounting for a convex internalized cost function calibrated to match equilibrium behavior. Current alcohol taxes ($1.09 per beer) cover only 27% of estimated external costs ($4.00 per beer), suggesting an optimal additional Pigouvian tax of $2.91 per beer. This policy would raise approximately $6.7 million annually for New York City while reducing consumption by 29% and improving allocative efficiency relative to quantity-based price controls.\n\nWe conduct extensive robustness checks including Monte Carlo simulation over 1,000 parameter combinations and sensitivity analysis of the assumed cross-price elasticity between tickets and beer. While we lack Yankees-specific transaction data, our results are robust to plausible parameter ranges and provide directionally reliable insights into the economics of stadium alcohol pricing and regulation.\n\nJEL Codes: H23 (Externalities), L83 (Sports), D62 (Externalities), H21 (Taxation)\n\nKeywords: price controls, Pigouvian taxation, sports economics, alcohol externalities, complementary goods, stadium pricing","type":"content","url":"/abstract#abstract","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Model Assumptions & Parameter Sources"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/assumptions","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Model Assumptions & Parameter Sources"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/assumptions","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Model Assumptions & Parameter Sources","lvl2":"Empirically Estimated vs Assumed"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/assumptions#empirically-estimated-vs-assumed","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Model Assumptions & Parameter Sources","lvl2":"Empirically Estimated vs Assumed"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/assumptions#empirically-estimated-vs-assumed","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Model Assumptions & Parameter Sources","lvl3":"✅ FROM LITERATURE (Empirical Estimates)","lvl2":"Empirically Estimated vs Assumed"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/assumptions#id-from-literature-empirical-estimates","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Model Assumptions & Parameter Sources","lvl3":"✅ FROM LITERATURE (Empirical Estimates)","lvl2":"Empirically Estimated vs Assumed"},"content":"Own-Price Elasticities:\n\nTicket demand: -0.49 to -0.76 \n\nNoll (1974)\n\nScully (1989)\n\nGeneral alcohol: -0.79 to -1.14 (not stadium-specific)\n\nConsumption Rates:\n\n40% of fans drink alcohol \n\nLenk et al.

Higher beer prices reduce consumption and associated negative externalities, including violence, public health costs, and drunk driving. However, beer sales represent a significant revenue stream for stadiums, with high profit margins that complement ticket revenue. This trade-off has motivated policy discussions about imposing price controls on stadium alcohol sales to address public health and safety concerns.\n\nThis paper analyzes the economic impacts of beer price controls at Yankee Stadium, one of the nation’s most prominent sports venues. We examine:\n\neffects on consumer welfare, stadium profit maximization across both ticket and beer revenue, attendance responses to price changes, and social externalities from alcohol consumption. We also evaluate current alcohol taxation relative to optimal Pigouvian benchmarks.","type":"content","url":"/intro#motivation","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction","lvl2":"Contribution"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/intro#contribution","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction","lvl2":"Contribution"},"content":"Our primary contribution is distinguishing between externalities that stadiums internalize through their profit maximization and those borne by society more broadly. We show that stadiums, as monopolists facing repeated interactions with customers, internalize negative effects that drunk fans impose on other attendees. These include increased security costs, reputational damage, and degradation of the stadium experience for other customers. We model these internalized costs as a convex function of total alcohol consumption, calibrated such that observed prices emerge as approximately profit-maximizing.\n\nThis distinction is economically important because only true social externalities that remain uninternalized by the stadium justify policy intervention beyond market outcomes. We estimate these remaining external costs at 4.00 per beer (comprising 2.50 for crime and violence and 1.50 for public health impacts), while current taxes total only 1.09 per beer, suggesting substantial under-taxation relative to the Pigouvian optimum.","type":"content","url":"/intro#contribution","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction","lvl2":"Main Findings"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/intro#main-findings","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction","lvl2":"Main Findings"},"content":"Our calibrated model yields several key results. First, we find that current pricing (average 80 tickets, 12.50 beer) is approximately profit-maximizing when accounting for taxes and internalized costs. The model predicts an optimal consumer beer price of $12.85, validating our calibration approach against observed market behavior.\n\nSecond, we identify a substantial Pigouvian tax gap. While external costs from alcohol consumption total approximately 4.00 per beer, current combined taxes amount to only 1.09 per beer, implying under-taxation of 73% relative to the social optimum. An additional tax of 2.91 per beer would fully internalize external costs while generating approximately 6.7 million in annual revenue for New York City.\n\nThird, we analyze the general equilibrium effects of a binding beer price ceiling. A 7 ceiling (representing a 44% reduction from current prices) induces substantial adjustments in ticket pricing due to complementarity between the two goods. Specifically, the stadium's profit-maximizing response is to raise ticket prices by approximately 32 (36% increase). This occurs because the beer price ceiling compresses beer profit margins from 6.41 to 1.35 per unit (after accounting for taxes and marginal costs). The stadium optimally shifts toward ticket revenue, despite this causing a 38% decline in attendance. Importantly, per-capita beer consumption increases by 108%, leading to a 97% increase in external costs contrary to the presumed policy objective.\n\nFourth, we find that alternative policies dominate price ceilings on efficiency grounds. A Pigouvian tax of 2.91 per beer would internalize external costs, reduce consumption by 29%, and generate 6.7 million annually in tax revenue without creating deadweight loss from binding quantity constraints. This represents the first-best policy response to the externality problem.","type":"content","url":"/intro#main-findings","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction","lvl2":"Theoretical Framework"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/intro#theoretical-framework","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction","lvl2":"Theoretical Framework"},"content":"Our model builds on the sports economics literature examining joint ticket-concession pricing \n\nKrautmann & Berri (2007)\n\nCoates & Humphreys (2007) while introducing an explicit treatment of internalized costs. Standard models of stadium pricing typically assume production costs are the only constraint on profit maximization. However, this fails to explain why stadiums charge $12.50 for beer when simple profit maximization with standard demand curves suggests much lower optimal prices.\n\nWe resolve this puzzle by recognizing that stadiums, as monopolists in a repeated game with their customer base, internalize negative externalities that intoxicated fans impose on other attendees. These internalized costs include direct expenses (enhanced security, cleanup, liability insurance) and indirect costs (reputational damage reducing future attendance, experience degradation lowering customer willingness to pay). We model these as a convex function of total alcohol consumption, with the convexity reflecting the compounding nature of alcohol-related incidents.\n\nIn contrast, true social externalities including crime in surrounding neighborhoods, burdens on public health systems, and drunk driving remain uninternalized by the stadium’s optimization problem. These provide the economic rationale for policy intervention through Pigouvian taxation or regulation.","type":"content","url":"/intro#theoretical-framework","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction","lvl2":"Data and Calibration"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/intro#data-and-calibration","position":10},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Introduction","lvl2":"Data and Calibration"},"content":"In the absence of proprietary transaction data from Yankee Stadium, we calibrate our model using publicly available information and parameters from the academic literature.
