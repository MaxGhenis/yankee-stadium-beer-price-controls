## Abstract

This paper analyzes the economic impacts of imposing price controls on beer sales at Yankee Stadium using a **heterogeneous consumer model** with two distinct fan types: non-drinkers (60%) and drinkers (40%). Our approach, calibrated to match empirical consumption patterns from {cite}`lenk2010alcohol`, achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to representative consumer specifications, reducing calibration error by 76%.

We simulate the effects of a \$7 beer price ceiling and document significant unintended consequences operating through complementarity and **selection effects**. The ceiling induces the stadium to raise ticket prices to \$77.29 (+9.7%), causing attendance to fall -5.7%. Total beer consumption nearly doubles (+98.3%) as per-fan consumption increases 110.2% (from 1.00 to 2.10 beers/fan), offsetting the attendance decline. Stadium profit falls \$-24.9M per season. The heterogeneous model reveals that drinkers respond less elastically to ticket price increases than non-drinkers, leading to selection effects that alter crowd composition.

Our analysis introduces two methodological innovations. First, we distinguish between costs that stadiums internalize (crowd management, brand damage, experience degradation affecting other customers) and true social externalities (neighborhood crime, public health costs). Second, we model heterogeneous consumer preferences, which not only improves calibration but reveals that price policies induce selection effects altering crowd composition. The heterogeneous model predicts an optimal beer price of \$12.51 compared to the observed \$12.50, validating that stadiums approximately profit-maximize while accounting for fan heterogeneity.

Current alcohol taxes (\$1.09 per beer) cover only 27% of estimated external costs (\$4.00 per beer), suggesting an optimal additional Pigouvian tax of \$2.91 per beer. This policy would raise approximately \$11.0 million annually for New York City while reducing consumption and improving allocative efficiency relative to quantity-based price controls. We provide extensive robustness checks and sensitivity analysis. While we lack Yankees-specific transaction data, our heterogeneous consumer framework provides more realistic predictions than representative consumer models and generates novel insights about selection effects in stadium alcohol regulation.
