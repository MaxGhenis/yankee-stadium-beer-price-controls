# Conclusions

## Key Findings

### 1. Observed Prices Are Profit-Maximizing

Stadium beer at \$12.50 is approximately profit-maximizing (\$12.85 optimal) when accounting for:
- Taxes (\$1.09/beer)
- Production costs (\$5.00/beer)
- **Internalized costs** (\$0.04-\$1.50/beer depending on volume)

### 2. Stadiums Already Internalize Some Externalities

Crowd management, brand damage, and experience degradation are **already priced in**:
- Convex cost function: $C_{intern}(Q) = 250 \cdot (Q/1000)^2$
- At low prices (\$5-7): Internalized costs become prohibitively high
- This explains why stadiums don't sell cheap beer despite apparent profit potential

### 3. Significant External Costs Remain

Society bears **\$4.00/beer** in external costs:
- Crime & violence: \$2.50
- Public health: \$1.50

Current taxes (\$1.09) cover only **27%** of these costs.

**Pigouvian tax gap: \$2.91/beer**

### 4. Price Ceiling (\$7) Has Mixed Effects

**Pros:**
- Consumer surplus: significant gains
- More affordable access

**Cons:**
- Stadium profit: \$-24.9M/season
- Externality costs: increase due to higher consumption
- May face legal/constitutional challenges

**Net:** Complex welfare trade-offs with distributional concerns.

### 5. Pigouvian Tax is More Efficient

Adding \$2.91/beer tax:
- ✓ Internalizes external costs
- ✓ Raises \$11.0M/year for affected communities
- ✓ Reduces consumption to optimal level
- ✓ No deadweight loss (price = social MC)
- ✓ Economically efficient

**Recommended policy**: Pigouvian tax over price controls.

## Policy Recommendations

### Recommended: Pigouvian Tax

**Implement \$2.91/beer additional tax on stadium alcohol**

- Consumer price: \$12.51 → \$15.41
- Consumption: reduces to optimal level
- Revenue: \$11.0M/year
- Allocate to Bronx community, public health, police

### Alternative: Moderate Hybrid

**If political constraints:**
- Moderate tax (+\$1.50/beer)
- Earlier sale cutoff (6th inning instead of 7th)
- Purchase limits (2 beers per transaction)

### Not Recommended: Price Ceiling

- Large stadium revenue loss
- Increases externalities
- Potential legal challenges
- Less efficient than taxation

## Broader Implications

### For Other Stadiums

This framework applies to all sports venues:
- NFL, NBA, NHL stadiums face similar trade-offs
- Internalized vs external costs distinction is general
- Optimal taxation varies by local externality levels

### For Alcohol Policy

**General principle**: Distinguish internalized from external costs.

Monopolists (stadiums, bars, restaurants) internalize negative effects on their own customers.

Policy should target **true external costs** (non-customers, public goods).

### For Price Control Theory

**Important insight**: Observed prices may reflect internalized externalities, not just production costs.

Standard models that ignore firm's internalization of customer experience effects will mis-predict optimal prices.

## Limitations

1. **Static model**: Doesn't capture long-run effects (season tickets, loyalty)
2. **Single representative consumer**: Ignores heterogeneity
3. **No substitution**: Doesn't model pre-game drinking or smuggling
4. **Partial equilibrium**: No competition from other entertainment
5. **Perfect enforcement**: Assumes price controls fully enforced

## Future Research

- **Heterogeneous consumers**: Casual vs regular fans
- **Dynamic model**: Repeated games, learning, habit formation
- **Substitution patterns**: Pre-game bars, tailgating
- **Spatial analysis**: Crime externalities by distance from stadium
- **Empirical validation**: Natural experiments with policy changes

## Final Thought

The key innovation is recognizing that **monopolists internalize negative effects on their own customers**.

This is why simple supply-demand models fail to predict stadium pricing - they miss the convex experience degradation costs that stadiums face.

For policy: Focus on **true external costs** (crime, public health) that remain uninternalized. Current taxes cover only 27% of these costs.

**Optimal policy: \$2.91/beer Pigouvian tax, raising \$11.0M/year for NYC.**
