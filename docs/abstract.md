## Abstract

This paper analyzes the economic impacts of imposing price controls on beer sales at Yankee Stadium. Using a calibrated partial equilibrium model with literature-based demand elasticities, we simulate the effects of a $7 beer price ceiling on consumer welfare, stadium revenue, attendance, and alcohol-related externalities. We find that such price controls generate substantial unintended consequences through complementarity effects between tickets and beer. Specifically, a $7 beer ceiling (44% reduction from current $12.50) induces the stadium to raise ticket prices by approximately $32 (36% increase), resulting in a 38% decline in attendance despite a 108% increase in per-capita beer consumption. Stadium profit falls by $575,000 per game ($47 million annually), while external costs from alcohol consumption increase by 97%.

Our analysis introduces a novel distinction between costs that stadiums internalize (crowd management, brand damage, experience degradation affecting other customers) and true social externalities (neighborhood crime, public health costs). We show that observed prices ($12.50) are approximately profit-maximizing when accounting for a convex internalized cost function calibrated to match equilibrium behavior. Current alcohol taxes ($1.09 per beer) cover only 27% of estimated external costs ($4.00 per beer), suggesting an optimal additional Pigouvian tax of $2.91 per beer. This policy would raise approximately $6.7 million annually for New York City while reducing consumption by 29% and improving allocative efficiency relative to quantity-based price controls.

We conduct extensive robustness checks including Monte Carlo simulation over 1,000 parameter combinations and sensitivity analysis of the assumed cross-price elasticity between tickets and beer. While we lack Yankees-specific transaction data, our results are robust to plausible parameter ranges and provide directionally reliable insights into the economics of stadium alcohol pricing and regulation.
