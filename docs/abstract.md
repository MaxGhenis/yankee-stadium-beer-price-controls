## Abstract

This paper analyzes the economic impacts of imposing price controls on beer sales at Yankee Stadium using a **heterogeneous consumer model** with two distinct fan types: non-drinkers (60%) and drinkers (40%). Our approach, calibrated to match empirical consumption patterns from {cite}`lenk2010alcohol`, achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to representative consumer specifications, reducing calibration error by 76%.

We simulate the effects of a \$7 beer price ceiling and document significant unintended consequences operating through complementarity and **selection effects**. Monte Carlo analysis across 1,000 parameter combinations confirms these findings are robust: tickets rise in >95% of scenarios, stadium profit falls in >99%, and beer consumption increases in >95%. Point estimates suggest the ceiling induces the stadium to raise ticket prices by 5-15% (depending on cross-price elasticity assumptions), causing attendance to fall 3-8%. Total beer consumption increases substantially as per-fan consumption rises (from 1.00 to approximately 2.0 beers/fan), offsetting the attendance decline. Stadium profit falls \$15-30M per season. The heterogeneous model reveals that drinkers respond less elastically to ticket price increases than non-drinkers, leading to selection effects that alter crowd composition.

Our analysis introduces two methodological innovations. First, we distinguish between costs that stadiums internalize (crowd management, brand damage, experience degradation affecting other customers) and true social externalities (neighborhood crime, public health costs). Second, we model heterogeneous consumer preferences, which not only improves calibration but reveals that price policies induce selection effects altering crowd composition. The heterogeneous model predicts an optimal beer price of \$12.51 compared to the observed \$12.50, validating that stadiums approximately profit-maximize while accounting for fan heterogeneity.

The consumption increase operates through two channels: an **intensive margin** (each drinker consumes more at lower prices) and an **extensive margin** (crowd composition shifts toward drinkers as ticket prices rise). We decompose these effects and show that selection effects account for a substantial portion of the total consumption change—a mechanism absent from representative agent models.

This is a simulation study using calibrated parameters rather than estimated ones; we lack Yankees-specific transaction data. However, the heterogeneous consumer framework provides more realistic predictions than representative consumer models and generates novel, testable insights about selection effects in stadium alcohol regulation. We provide extensive Monte Carlo robustness checks demonstrating that qualitative conclusions hold across wide parameter ranges.
