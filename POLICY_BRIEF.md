# Policy Brief: Beer Price Controls at Yankee Stadium

**One-Page Summary for Policymakers**

---

## The Question

Should NYC impose price controls on beer at Yankee Stadium to reduce alcohol consumption and externalities?

---

## TL;DR

**❌ Price ceilings are counterproductive**
**✅ Pigouvian tax (+$2.91/beer) is superior**

---

## Analysis: $7 Beer Price Ceiling

### Intended Effects
- ✅ Lower beer prices ($12.50 → $7.00)
- ✅ More affordable for consumers

### UNINTENDED Consequences

| Impact | Change |
|--------|--------|
| **Ticket prices** | **+$32 (+36%)** ⚠️ |
| Attendance | -38% |
| Beer per fan | +108% (1.0 → 2.1 beers) |
| Stadium profit | **-$47M/season** |
| Externality costs | **+97%** (more alcohol) |

**Economic mechanism:**
1. Beer ceiling crushes beer margin (stadium receives $11.41 → $6.35)
2. Stadium shifts to ticket revenue (raises prices 36%)
3. Higher tickets reduce attendance 38%
4. Net result: BOTH revenue sources fall, externalities RISE

---

## Current Situation

### Prices & Taxes
- Consumer pays: **$12.50/beer**
- Stadium receives: **$11.41** (after $1.09 taxes)
- Current taxes: Excise $0.07 + Sales $1.02

### Externalities
- **External costs**: **$4.00/beer** (crime $2.50 + health $1.50)
- **Current taxes**: $1.09/beer
- **Gap**: **$2.91/beer** (73% undertaxed)

### Stadium Already Internalizes Some Costs
- Crowd management, security: Built into pricing
- Brand/reputation damage: Affects future revenue
- Experience degradation: Drunk fans hurt other customers

**These are already in the $12.50 price** ✓

## Policy Options Ranked

### 1. Pigouvian Tax: +$2.91/beer ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**How it works:**
- Add $2.91/beer tax (on top of current $1.09)
- Consumer pays: $15.41
- Fully internalizes external costs

**Effects:**
- ✅ Consumption: -29% (optimal reduction)
- ✅ Revenue: **+$6.7M/season** for NYC
- ✅ Externalities: Reduced proportionally
- ✅ No deadweight loss (efficient)
- ✅ Stadium keeps pricing autonomy

**Use revenue for:**
- 40% Bronx community programs
- 30% Public health / ER capacity
- 20% NYPD game-day resources
- 10% MTA safety

### 2. Price Floor: $15-16

**Effects:**
- Consumption: -20%
- Stadium profit: Unchanged or higher
- Externalities: Reduced
- Government revenue: $0

**Equivalent to** giving stadium the Pigouvian tax revenue.

### 3. Hybrid Policy

**Combine:**
- Moderate tax (+$1.50/beer)
- Earlier cutoff (6th inning, not 7th)
- 2-beer purchase limit

**If** Pigouvian tax politically difficult.

### 4. Price Ceiling ❌ NOT RECOMMENDED

**Problems:**
- Tickets rise 36% (unintended)
- Stadium revenue: -$47M/season
- Externalities INCREASE 97%
- Attendance falls 38%
- Inefficient (deadweight loss)
- Constitutional concerns

### 5. Beer Ban ❌ TOO EXTREME

- Eliminates $2M/game revenue
- May shift to pre-game drinking
- Extreme attendance impact

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Current | Pigouvian Tax | $7 Ceiling |
|--------|---------|---------------|------------|
| Consumer beer price | $12.50 | $15.41 | $7.00 |
| Ticket price | $80 | ~$85 | $121 |
| Beers/fan | 1.0 | 0.7 | 2.1 |
| Stadium profit/game | $2.3M | $2.1M | $1.7M |
| External costs/game | $158k | $113k | $311k |
| NYC revenue/season | $3.5M | $10.2M | $3.8M |

## Distributional Effects

### Who Wins/Loses from $7 Ceiling?

**Winners:**
- Some consumers (if beer important, ticket price doesn't deter)

**Losers:**
- Stadium (-$47M/season)
- Price-sensitive fans (can't afford $121 tickets)
- Bronx community (externalities +97%)

### Who Wins from Pigouvian Tax?

**Winners:**
- NYC (+$6.7M for public services)
- Society (externalities reduced)
- Affected communities (revenue targeted)

**Losers:**
- Beer drinkers (pay more)
- Stadium (slightly lower volume, but minimal impact)

---

## Bottom Line

**Price ceiling:** Backfires. Tickets rise, externalities increase.

**Pigouvian tax:** Efficient, raises revenue, reduces harm.

**Recommendation:** $2.91/beer additional tax, revenue to affected communities.
