## Notes on Literature Gaps

1. **Limited MLB-specific beer elasticity estimates**: Most studies aggregate across concessions
2. **Heterogeneity**: Elasticities likely vary by team, market, fan demographics
3. **Dynamic effects**: Most studies are static; season ticket holder responses unclear
4. **Substitution patterns**: Limited evidence on pre-game drinking substitution
5. **Optimal policy**: Few papers explicitly derive social optimum with externalities

## Data Limitations

- Proprietary stadium data (sales by SKU) not publicly available
- Cross-sectional variation limited (most stadiums have similar policies)
- Causal identification challenging (no randomized beer price experiments)
- Externality costs vary by context and measurement approach
