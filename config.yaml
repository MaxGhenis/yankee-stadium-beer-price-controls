  interpretation: |
    The remaining gaps are economically meaningful:

    1. BEER ($14.26 model vs $12.50 observed):
       Yankees price BELOW profit-maximum for:
       - Fan goodwill and social responsibility
       - Avoiding "price gouging" perception
       - Long-term fan relationships

    2. TICKETS ($69.67 model vs $80 observed):
       Yankees price ABOVE profit-maximum for:
       - Brand value and exclusivity
       - Premium positioning
       - Luxury experience signaling

    This cross-subsidization (cheap beer, expensive tickets relative to profit-max)
    is consistent with Yankees brand strategy.

    For policy analysis, the model is used for COMPARATIVE STATICS (how policies
    change outcomes), not exact price prediction. The $1.76 beer gap doesn't
    affect comparative analysis since all scenarios use the same demand structure.
